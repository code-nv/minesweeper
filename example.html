			// Create a function called 'ageInSeconds' that can be passed a number as an argument and will return your age in seconds

			// Create a function called 'shouldSing', which can be passed a boolean as an argument and if that boolean is true will sing a song

			// Pass a function to the set Interval method so that it logs out the word 'Ping!' every five seconds

			// Given the following array:
			const movies = [
				{ name: "fast and the furious", genre: "action" },
				{ name: "monty python and the holy grail", genre: "comedy" },
				{ name: "spiderman", genre: "superhero" },
				{ name: "the avengers", genre: "superhero" },
				{ name: "wayne's world", genre: "comedy" },
				{ name: "the theory of everything", genre: "drama" },

			// Use the map method to produce an array containing just the names of the movies

			// Now do the same thing, but this time take the map method's callback function, define it separately, and pass a reference to it as the callback

			// Use the filter method to get only the superhero movies

			// Now do the same thing as above, but this time take the filter method's callback function, define it separately, and pass a reference to it as the callback

			// Using the methods you created a above, generate an array containing only the names of movies that are super hero movies

			// Using the reduce method, create an array containing only the unique names of genres (ie 'comedy', 'drama', etc. should only appear once each)

			// Now do the same thing as above, but this time take the reduce method's callback function, define it separately, and pass a reference to it as a callback

			// Given the following code:
			const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35];

			const printDoubles = numbers.forEach((number) => {
				// console.log(number * 2);
			});

			// How could we pass a function in as a reference to the argument for forEach instead of relying on the anonymous callback we have declared?
